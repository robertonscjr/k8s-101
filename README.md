# Quickstart Kubernetes

This repository aims to facilitate the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster that has more than one node.

For this repository to work, you need **ssh access** to the nodes and some allowed ports for access the **Control Plane Node** through [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/pt/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/). 

## Node Requirements

A Node in Kubernetes is literally the machine (bare metal or virtual machine) on which the K8s components will be installed.

To know more about the Node concept, [click here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/).

Node minimal setup:

* CPU: 2
* RAM: 2GB
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04

For the proper functioning of the scripts, **ensure that you have SSH access to the instances.**

## Client Requirements

The client is the machine where **kubectl** will be configured, which is the command we use to interact with the **Control Plane Node**. 

Requirements:

* python 3.6+
* virtualenv

You need **superuser access** to be able to install the requirements.

## Network Access Requirements

To configure the required port accesses for the nodes, see [**Check required ports**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#check-required-ports).

In the case of using VMs, the cloud providers have the area for configuring **Security Groups**.

## Run

If you followed the previous steps, ensuring that the restrictions for each section are resolved, set the environment variable of the key which will be used to access the nodes:
```bash
$ export SSH_KEYFILE="~/.ssh/NODE_PK"
```

Edit the [**nodes**](nodes) file with the IPs of the hosts:
```bash
$ # edit this file with your node/host/VM IPs
$ cat nodes

[control-plane]
10.0.0.1

[worker]
10.0.0.2
10.0.0.3
```

Finally, run:
```bash
$ bash run.sh
```

Installation and configuration usually takes a few minutes...
